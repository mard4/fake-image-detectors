Another interesting result presented in \cite{boato2024adversarial} regards the \textit{cross-detector} scenario, in which the attack is performed targeting a specific detector but then another is used in the evaluation. Also, \textit{stacked attacks} are considered, in which an image is sequentially attacked against different detectors. An evaluation in these regards reveal mixed results: a misaligned attack in not effective, while the performances of a stacked attack are highly dependant on both the order of the attacks and the detector used in the evaluation. Nevertheless, this is an interesting scenario open for further studies.
